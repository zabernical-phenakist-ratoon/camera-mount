camera-mount
============
Description:
-------------------------
There are a number of key fob video recorders on the market. This item may work with multiple brands or models. I've forgotten specifically which one I have.

3D print these STLs to mount one of those key fobs to the mid-section of a super cub fuselage.

What is a super cub? Look here: http://www.hobbyforce.com/1256-3539/Airplanes/SUPER-CUB-DSM-RTF.aspx

The idea is to provide a mount for the camera that keeps it pointed at an ideal angle and allows it to quickly be removed and re-installed.

"Recording samples.mp4" is a 2 minute video showing clips extracted from several different flights, including a night flight.

This assembly has proven very robust. I have had some spectacular crashes and the camera never budged. Make sure the clip is fully snapped on before take off though. I have had it fall off about 15 feet in front of me when it wasn't.

Instructions:
-------------------------
* Print "camera_mount_holder.stl" and "camera_mount_clip.stl". You will need 1 of each regardless of your next choice.
* Do you want a better view of things nearer to the plane on the ground? Consider using "camera_mount_Wedge.stl" - It points slightly more towards the ground.
* Do you want a better view of the horizon? Use "camera_mount_V1_Wedge.stl" - it points more forward
* Print 2 wedges of whichever variety you like.
* Still don't understand what to print? Take a peak at "Recomended_plate.stl". It has everything in one fell swoop.
* Glue the wedges to the base (the side that was on the build plate) of "camera_mount_holder.stl".
* Heat up *ONLY* the center area of "camera_mount_clip.stl". You want it soft enough to be pliable, but not fully molten.
* Install the key fob into "camera_mount_holder.stl" and snap "camera_mount_clip.stl" over it while it is still soft. DO NOT FORCE THE CLIP ON!!! If it isn't pliable enough, it may over-compress the key fob and damage it.
* When done right, "camera_mount_clip.stl" will be form-fitted to your key fob and everything will be snugly clamped in place. It will be just tight enough to stop the key fob from rattling around.
* Locate a mounting point. I recommend putting it just behind the anti-crash sensor on the bottom of the fuselage. This provides a good view of things while having minimal impact on the balance of the plane.
* Glue or tape (I used packing tape that was strung through the center of the wedges) the assembly to the super cub.
* See "tn_plane4.jpg" for an example of the final assembly.
